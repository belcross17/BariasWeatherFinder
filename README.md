# BA Weather Finder
This app was created with the sole purpose to provide a user with an easy access to todays weather as well as the following 5 days. A server side API was implemented in order to gather the information requested by the user. jQuery as well as Bootstrap were implemented in the creation of the app, in order to provide a more simple and clean code. Separate functions were implemented in order to provide a easier layout and sustainability for future updates. Multiple global variables were also placed in order to keep an easy access to the information already gather by the user.
